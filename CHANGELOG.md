# Changelog

All notable changes to this repo are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and the packages follow
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

This is a monorepo. The Rust crate (`ev_lib`, imported as `ev`) is versioned as a
single unit; each TypeScript package under `ts/` is versioned independently.
Entries are grouped into dated release waves, since most changes land across the
Rust crate and its TypeScript mirror at once.

| Package                            | Source                 | Version |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ------- |
| `ev_lib` (Rust crate, `use ev::…`) | `rust/`                | 0.5.0   |
| `@evinvest/uikit`                  | `ts/uikit/`            | 0.6.0   |
| `@evinvest/analytics`              | `ts/analytics/`        | 0.1.2   |
| `@evinvest/architecture`           | `ts/architecture/`     | 0.1.0   |
| `@evinvest/error-monitoring`       | `ts/error-monitoring/` | 0.1.0   |
| `@evinvest/experiments`            | `ts/experiments/`      | 0.1.0   |

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- `error_monitoring` (Rust, native): a malformed or empty `Config.dsn` now
  disables reporting instead of panicking at boot, matching the wasm and TS
  ports' documented no-op contract — a monitoring typo no longer crash-loops
  the service.
- `uikit` (**both ports**): `CommandEmpty` renders only when a query matched
  nothing. It gated on "is there a query", so "No results found." showed next to
  matching items; items now register their value through the Command context, so
  the empty state can tell "nothing matched" from "nothing is here". The query is
  trimmed once and shared by the item filter and the empty-state gate, so blank
  input is uniformly not a search (it previously hid every item **and** the empty
  state, leaving a blank palette).

## 2026-07-07 — uikit 0.6.0 · Rust brand-chrome catch-up

Rust `ev_lib` 0.5.0 · `@evinvest/uikit` 0.6.0. The Dioxus port catches up to two
TypeScript uikit releases — uikit 0.5.0 (Header density variants) and 0.6.0 (the
shared status pages), both 2026-07-06 — so both ports render one identical shell
again. Those two TS releases are folded into this single wave; the crate ships as
one versioned unit, so `ev_lib` 0.5.0 covers both.

### Added

- **Status pages — `StatusScreen` + `NotFound` / `Forbidden` / `ServerError`**
  (Rust; TS since uikit 0.6.0, 2026-07-06): the shared 404 / 403 / 500 surface
  ported from site_conductor — a centred hero (skyline-crown mark, mono eyebrow,
  Playfair code, italic-accent headline, CTAs) with a per-status accent
  (`StatusAccent`: teal / gold / red / blue). The ready-made pages bake in their
  copy; a host passes only hrefs. `ServerError`'s retry runs a host `reset` or
  reloads. `status_button_class` is exposed for bespoke CTAs.
    - TS: `linkComponent` routes CTAs through `next/link` for soft nav.
    - Dioxus: renders plain `<a>` (a full document load, as an error page wants —
      no `linkComponent` equivalent) and reloads via `document::eval`.
- **`Header` — `compact` variant + `hideNav`** (Rust; TS since uikit 0.5.0,
  2026-07-06): `variant="compact"` (Rust `HeaderVariant::Compact`) is a fixed
  short opaque bar for app surfaces — no scroll growth, a known 4rem height a
  sticky sidebar can butt flush against; `marketing` (default) keeps the
  scroll-aware bar. `hideNav` (`hide_nav`) drops the nav — desktop row + mobile
  menu — keeping just the lockup and CTA.

## 2026-07-04 — uikit 0.4.0

Rust `ev_lib` 0.4.0 · `@evinvest/uikit` 0.4.0. The EV brand chrome, mirrored
across both ports, so every surface (site_conductor, cabinet, REA) renders one
identical shell (EV-invest/site_conductor#55).

### Added

- **Brand chrome — `Header` / `Footer` / `Logo`** (Rust + TS): the site shell
  ported from site_conductor's `application/layout`. Scroll-aware fixed header
  with brand lockup, desktop nav and a built-in full-screen mobile menu; the
  12-col footer (sitemap groups, offices, optional newsletter slot, build-version
  line); the mark as a self-contained data-URI CSS mask (no asset pipeline).
  Nav items and CTAs stay app-side — the kit owns only the chrome.
    - TS: `linkComponent` prop lets Next hosts pass `next/link`; default `<a>`.
    - Dioxus: web behaviors (scroll state, body-scroll lock, Escape,
      close-on-navigate delegation) via `document::eval`, SSR-safe no-op.
## 2026-06-22 — uikit 0.3.0

Rust `ev_lib` 0.3.0 · `@evinvest/uikit` 0.3.0. The toast (`sonner`) animation
suite, mirrored across both ports. ([#12])

### Added

- **Toast / `sonner` animation suite** (Rust + TS): Sonner-style enter/exit
  animation, stacking that collapses into a pile and expands on hover/focus, and
  a host-timer-free CSS lifecycle.
    - TS: swipe-to-dismiss, hover-to-pause auto-dismiss, and persistent
      (no-duration) toasts.
    - Dioxus: stacking + expand-on-hover mirrored; auto-dismiss driven by a no-op
      CSS `ev-toast-life` animation (no host timer); the enter plays as a keyframe
      on DOM insertion (fixes the Dioxus appear).
- **Viewers** for previewing the kit against live code: a React example app
  (`ts/uikit/example`) and a Dioxus viewer crate (`rust/uikit-viewer`).

### Changed

- The Rust crate is published to crates.io as **`ev_lib`** (the `ev` name was
  taken); the import path stays **`use ev::…`**.
- Native `analytics` / `error_monitoring` backends moved to **`reqwest` 0.13**
  (rustls).
- Applied `codestyle` formatting.

### Fixed

- Toast restack settles instead of bouncing back; stacked toasts stay inside the
  viewport edge; the enter no longer couples to the restack (rapid-fire lag).

## 2026-06-20 — uikit 0.2.0

Rust `ev` 0.2.0 · `@evinvest/uikit` 0.2.0. ([#8])

### Added

- `Container` component.
- Responsive page-gutter and radius tokens.

> The Rust crate's `0.2.0` also folds in everything since `0.1.0` — the whole
> `uikit` feature and the three I/O libraries below — because the crate ships as
> one versioned unit.

## 2026-06-18 — analytics · error-monitoring · experiments 0.1.0

Three opt-in I/O libraries, each mirrored Rust ↔ TS and gated per target.
([#6], [#7])

### Added

- **`analytics`** — PostHog product analytics (`@evinvest/analytics`; Rust
  `analytics` feature). `@evinvest/analytics` **0.1.2** (2026-06-19) added the
  `/next` subpath and buffered captures behind a single pageview. ([#7])
- **`error-monitoring`** — Sentry (`@evinvest/error-monitoring`; Rust
  `error_monitoring` feature, native-only `sentry` crate).
- **`experiments`** — frontend-only, zero-runtime-dep A/B testing
  (`@evinvest/experiments`; Rust `experiments` feature), reporting exposure
  through an injected sink.

### Fixed

- `experiments`: the TS `pickVariant` zero-total fallback now matches Rust.

## 2026-06-16 — uikit 0.1.1 / 0.1.2 · public npm

The big `uikit` PR landed and the packages went public on npm. ([#2])

### Added

- npm publishing: packages scoped under **`@evinvest`** (the `@ev` scope was
  taken); `@evinvest/uikit` ships as a `"use client"` bundle for RSC / the App
  Router.

### Fixed

- `0.1.1` — Slider thumb position and Portal/floating sync; overlays no longer
  jump to the top-left.
- `0.1.2` — Slider drag from the thumb; dropped the exit animation that caused an
  overlay close flicker.

### Build

- Pinned the Rust nightly toolchain via `rust-toolchain.toml` (codestyle emits
  nightly-only features).

## 2026-06-15 — uikit 0.1.0 · architecture (TypeScript) 0.1.0

### Added

- **`@evinvest/uikit` 0.1.0** / Rust `uikit` feature — a dep-light UI kit
  mirrored Rust (Dioxus) ↔ TS (React) with a shared design-token contract:
    - Tier A — 22 static components.
    - Behaviour primitives — controllable state, portal, floating, dismiss, focus
      scope, presence, roving focus.
    - Tiers B / C / D — 41 interactive, overlay & engine components.
- **`@evinvest/architecture` 0.1.0** — the DDD kernel ported to TypeScript,
  mirroring the Rust `architecture` feature's semantics (zero runtime deps,
  I/O-free).

### Build

- Adopted the `v_flakes` org Nix toolchain; relocated the `ev` crate into `rust/`
  under a root workspace; configured prettier; added the docs/README fragments
  and per-package READMEs.

## 2026-06-14 — Initial scaffold

Rust `ev` 0.1.0.

### Added

- Scaffolded the `ev` shared-libs monorepo with the **`architecture`** DDD kernel
  as the first Rust feature — zero-dep, I/O-free, and `wasm32`-safe (host-only id
  minting gated behind `cfg(not(target_arch = "wasm32"))`).
